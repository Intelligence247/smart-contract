// Layer 1: THis is the base layer of the blockchain ecosystem in which transactions
// are executed and confirmed. This is a blockchain in it purest form. Also referred to as the 
// the settlement layer, it is the one other chain rest on and it is the beginning, Example is BTC ETH BNB AVALANCHE

// Layer 2: This is anyting built on top of the layer1
// Defined: Secondary framework or protocols, that is built ON TOP of the Layer1

// Rollup
// Blockchain Rollup: This is a scaling solution that increases the number of 
// transactions on the L1 chain.

// The two types of Rollup are 
// 1. Optimistic Rollup (Assumes Transactions are legitimate or valid by default) 
// 2. ZK Rollup (Zero Knowledge): THis uses validity or ZK proof to 
// verify transaction correctness

// ZK proofs: This is an algorithm that verifies that a "prover" 
// knows something to a "vefired" without revealing the information

// One of the type of operator is Sequencer, Sequencer is responsible for ordering transactions and sometimes bundling them together
