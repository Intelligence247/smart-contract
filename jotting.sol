Learning about Ethereum
## Eth is often referred to as the "World Computer"

## ETH is an open source that executes programs called smart contract

## It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a cryptocurrency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.

## Ethereum’s language is Turing complete, meaning that Ethereum can straightforwardly function as a general-purpose computer.

## Ethereum's Four Stage Development
//A stage may include subreleases, known as "hard forks," that change functionality in a way that is not backward compatible.
##  The intermediate hard forks that have occurred to date are codenamed Ice Age, DAO, Tangerine Whistle, Spurious Dragon, Byzantium, Constantinople/St. Petersburg, Istanbul and Muir Glacier.
The four stages are codenamed 1.Frontier 2.Homestead 3.Metropolis 4.Serenity
Ethereum runs on the Ethereum main network, which is addressable on TCP port 30303, and runs a protocol called ÐΞVp2p.

## Ethereum state transitions are processed by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

Ethereum and Turing Completeness
As soon as you start reading about Ethereum, you will immediately encounter the term "Turing complete." Ethereum, they say, unlike Bitcoin, is Turing complete. What exactly does that mean?

Alan Turing further defined a system to be Turing complete if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. Such a system is called a Universal Turing machine (UTM).

## In a world computer, a program that abuses resources gets to abuse the world’s resources

## You may see DApps spelled as ÐApps. The Ð character is the Latin character called "ETH," alluding to Ethereum. To display this character, use the Unicode codepoint 0xD0, or if necessary the HTML character entity eth (or decimal entity #208).
